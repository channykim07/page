# Shell

## Git

* uses sha-1 to compare hash

### Convention

* Uses present tense for commit message

> Terms

* branch
  * simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits

```sh
^(n)          # previous branch (nth parent)
~n            # n previous branch
```

* main (master before 2020.10)
  * default name for the first branch in convention, this contains the local development

* stage
  * a cache of files that you want to commit

* HEAD
  * pointer to the current branch

* origin
  * alias on your system for a particular remote repository

* workspace
  * where actual files are

* index (staging area)
  * where commits are prepared

* Merge
  * independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch

* fast-forwarding
  * try to merge C1 with a C2 that can be reached by following commit history, just move pointer forward

* squash
  * technique that helps you to take a series of commits and condense it to a few commits

* Repository
  * container that tracks the changes to your project files

* Bare repository
  * Repository without workspace
  * Can be used in a shared folder

* Issue
  * "fix \#33" commit messages closes issue

### Files

> .git

```sh
cat .git/HEAD        # see head
rm -rf .git          # Delete git repository
```

> .gitignore

```sh
*                    # Ignore everything    
!*.py                # But not these files...
```

> .gitconfig

```sh
[user]
    name = Gyuseung Hwang
    email = sean@remote.host
[credential]

```

> .gitcredentials

```sh
Username: sean
Password: ss
```

> .gitmodules

* config file that stores mapping between project’s URL and local subdir

-p        # add some parts of files
-u        # Update or remove previously tracked files from the entire working tree
```

> commit

![alt](images/20210206_115808.png)

* move files in staging area to local repository

```sh
--amend -m "new"      # change previous commit message
-a                    # automatically stage files that have been modified and deleted
-m msg                # given <msg> as the commit message
--signoff             # certifies who is the author of the commit
close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, resolved  # with following message close issue
git reset --soft HEAD@{1} && git commit -C HEAD@{1}                    # undo git commit --amend

remote local_br(:remote_br) # (omit one if identical)
origin branch               # push only one specific branch
origin --delete master      # delete branch

-f origin HEAD:master       # push detached head
-f origin commit:branch     # undo push
```

### Backward

![alt](images/20210218_015026.png)

> Clone

```sh
ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/      # does no authentication
http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
native transport (i.e. git:// URL) and should be used with caution on unsecured networks.
<folder>        # get a local copy of an existing repository (default cwd)
--depth 1       # shallow clone
--recurse-submodules  # initialize, update each submodule in repository
-b / --branch   # clone branch
--bare          # clone bare repository
-j <n>, --jobs <n>  # number of submodules fetched at the same time.
```

> Fetch

* Before Fetch (left : Local, right : Remote with new bugFix)
![alt](images/20210206_120406.png)

* After Fetch
![alt](images/20210206_120442.png)

* downloads commits that remote has but missing from local repository and updates remote branches point
* does not change anything about your local state

```sh
--all && git reset --hard origin/master    # Download from remote and discard all 
--unshallow                          # fetch all older commits from shallow clone
```

> pull

* before pull
![alt](images/20210206_120545.png)

* after pull

![alt](images/20210206_120616.png)

```sh
[repo] [ref]                  # fetch + merge
--allow-unrelated-histories   # merge different git repository
origin master                 # update local copy with commits from remote repo
-C <git-working-directory> pull <git remote>  # pull in other directory
```

> Checkout

![alt](images/20210206_115843.png)

* checkout will also update HEAD to set the specified branch as the current branch

```sh
branch          # switch to branch
commit          # update HEAD
filename        # Discard changes in the working directory
origin/master   # check out remote 
-b branch       # create a new branch, use it 
-f branch commit # Reset <branch> to <commit>, even if <branch> exists
```

> Reset

![alt](images/20210206_115937.png)

```sh
tree path      # Unstage all changes in one file
file           # Unstage a file
HEAD filename  # Discard all changes from previous commit
--hard branch  # throws away all uncommitted changes
```

> Revert

![alt](images/20210206_120017.png)

* forward-moving undo

```sh
branch         # Creates new commit of existing commit
commit         # Undo commits in a public branch
```

### Branch

![alt](images/20210218_015121.png)

* the starred branch is your current branch

> branch

```sh
<>                    # show branch
branch                # create name <branch> 
-d / -D name          # Delete merged branch / not merged in upstream branch

-f b1 b2              # Move b1 to b2
-m A <B>              # Rename branch (current to A (A to B)
-u o/master (branch)  # set branch to track o/master (current branch)
-vv                   # Show all the local branches of your rep

-mc branch2           # branch2 will be created
--merged | egrep -v "(^\*|master|main|dev)" | xargs git branch -d        # delete merged branches
```

> cherry-pick

```sh
C1 C2          # copy C1, C2, … to our current HEAD
C1...C2        # copy commit from C1 to C2 to our current HEAD 
```

> Merge

* On feature branch
* Left : git merge master
* Right : git rebase master
![alt](images/20210206_120704.png)

```sh
--unset-upstream main               # unset upstream branch
branch_name                  # merge with another branch
-s ours branch1 branch2 branchN    # merge result is always that of the current branch HEAD
```

> mergetool

```sh
<>                # run left
```

* git config merge.conflictstyle diff3

```sh
<<<<<<<
This is the branch that I have currently checked out (i.e. HEAD).
|||||||
The common ancestor version.
=======
Changes made on the branch that is being merged in. This is often a feature branch
.>>>>>>>
```

> Rebase

* integrating changes from one branch onto another
* pastes feature branch to the end of the master branch

```sh
a (b)            # a → b (current if omitted)
- i --root       # Interactive rebase / from root
fetch && origin/master  # Merge remote master to the local branch
```

## Github

### CLI

```
gh gist create filename    # push to gist
```

```
?file=afile            # only one file in gist
```

### workflow

> name

* workflow name GitHub displays on your repository's actions page. 
* If omit name, GitHub sets it to workflow file path relative to root of the repository

> action

* standalone commands that are combined into steps to create a job
* smallest portable building block of a workflow

> on push | [push, pull]

* Specify the event that automatically triggers the workflow file

> events

* specific activity that triggers a workflow

> workflow

* an automated procedure that you add to your repository. 
* made up of one or more jobs and can be scheduled or triggered by an event.

### Function

* Vimscript functions must start with a capital letter if they are unscoped

```sh
let temp = @@
let @@ = temp  : prevent overwriting current register

function Varg(...)
a:000    # a list containing all the extra arguments that were passed
a:0      # number of argument
a:1      # first argument
```

* C Prototype Function

```
func! CPrototypeFunction()
let temp = @@
    exe "normal! mayy"
    exe "normal! /Prototypes\<CR>"
    exe "normal! )kpA;\<ESC>"
    exe "normal@ 'a"
let @@ = temp
endfunc
